# Custom Set

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some
type, like a set. In this exercise you will define your own set. How it
works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of
unique elements.

## Running tests

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)
